# Stepcraft-GRBL
Arduino Uno Shield for Stepcraft GRBL Controller

This is a shield to control STEPCRAFT mills via the LPT port.

(it could be easily modified to work without the LPT module directly plugged into the X1 socket)

An Arduino UNO is used with GRBL firmware and this shield.

The build option USE_SPINDLE_DIR_AS_ENABLE_PIN is needed for GRBL to work with this shield.

It works like a charm on the STEPCRAFT-2/840 with HF500 Spindle attached.

Created with KiCAD, pcb2gcodeGUI and milled on the STEPCRAFT mill itself.
